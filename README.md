Graceful degradation and service workers both help improve the user experience by allowing web applications to still work in many circumstances. Graceful degradation specifically is for making a system that maintains core functionality when other parts of it fail. Service workers are just scripts that run in the background to enbale features for offline loading. Using service workers is an effective way to implement graceful degradation.
